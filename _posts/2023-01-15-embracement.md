## Embracement !! 

I just used this as a silly word play between embrace and embarass.

I was going through my previous posts. I saw that what I write is fairly difficult to understand. It is embarrassing. I am pretty sure that I have the same issues in my verbal communications. However, I am able to use that to my advantage in my day to day life as physician. See, if a patient cannot understand me, that usually means that they are inattentive and inattention is a hallmark of delirium. :angel face emoji here:

I am a walking delirium radar !!
