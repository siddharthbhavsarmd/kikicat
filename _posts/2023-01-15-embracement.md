## Embracement !! 

I just used this as a silly word play between embrace and embarrass.

I was going through my previous posts. I saw that what I write is fairly difficult to understand. It is embarrassing. I might have the same issues with verbal communications (ESL). I have learned to take advantage of it as a physician. If a patient can understand me, that usually means that they are attentive. :angel face emoji here:
