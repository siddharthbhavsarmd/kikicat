This is a traditional title when something new is created by porgrammers. I saw a comic from India recently. He mentioned that he was programmer by race. He was peer pressured into engineering. I am also from India. I wanted to go into engineering, unfortunately it did not work out, but I still like computers. Now I am planning to pursue this as hobby. We are going to dicuss books, pets, TV shows and life in general.
