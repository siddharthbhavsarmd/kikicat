This change was bound to create controversy. So far my understanding is that twitter remains free, but if you want to get that blue tick mark (a clear indicator of success in real world setting) you have to pay twitter on monthly basis. Currently fees are I think around 8 USD, I am pretty sure the price will go up as time progresses. 

I think, this will be a good change. A lot of people used to confuse blue tick as some type of official seal. Now, it is out in open that you dont need much to become an official armchair expert. Everything on twitter should be assumed to be personal opinion of someone who can pay 8$ a month. 

We are living in such an amazing times, we can see events happening across the globe live. However, rumors are out performing real news by huge margin. Gone is the era of news papers and TV news with neutral faces. These mediums are not immune to bias, however the editors and authors did take pride in making sure that they delivered correct news to their audience. 

The reason why twitter is popular, is a fault in human psyche. "Stolen Focus" is an amazing book that mentions this, we like things that create emotional response. Reading something emotinally charged creates a dopamine rush in our brain and we want more hits of that. We want our information to be 140 words or less, that makes our hits more frequent. Now this emotional response could be anything. Joy, grief, greed are good examples. All social media will show content that will keep us on them for longer period of time (so we can see more ads). So certain type of people tend to aggregagte on certain websites. This creates echo chambers. Twitter is echo chamber of outrage. 

I think stolen focus is a good book. Author attempts to point out how social media has changed our life.
